# From the Tensor to Stable Diffusion

Inspired by [From the Transistor][0].

Machine learning is hard, a lot of tutorials are hard to follow, and
it's hard to understand [software 2.0][1] from first principles.

## Section 1: Intro: Cheating our way past the Tensor -- 0.5 weeks

So about those Tensors -- Course overview. Describe how Deep Learning models are buildable using Tensors and how different architectures like CNNs and RNNs use Tensors in different ways. Understand the concept of backpropagation and gradient descent.

Accelerated learning -- Training on a personal computer limits the reach of this course. Using something like Google Colab will allow anyone with a computer to play.

## Section 2: Bringup: What language is deep learning coded in? -- 0.5 weeks

Building a simple Neural Network(Python, 10) -- Your first little program! Getting the simulator working. Learning the basics of deep learning.

Building a simple CNN(Python, 100) -- An intro chapter to deep learning, learn how to build a simple CNN and understand the concepts of convolution and pooling.

## Section 3: Deep Learning: What is deep learning anyway? -- 2 weeks

Building a simple RNN(Python, 500) -- Learn the basics of Recurrent Neural Networks, understand the concepts of LSTM and GRU cells.

Building a GAN(Python, 500) -- Learn how to build a simple Generative Adversarial Network, understand the concept of adversarial training.

## Section 4: Advanced Deep Learning: A “high” level deep learning -- 4 weeks

Building a Transformer(Python, 1000) -- Learn about the transformer architecture and its application in NLP tasks.

Building a Stable Diffusion model(Python, 3000) -- Learn about the Stable Diffusion architecture and its application in image generation tasks.

## Section 5: Deployment: Putting deep learning models into production -- 3 weeks

Building a REST API(Python, 500) -- Learn how to deploy a deep learning model as a REST API, understand the concepts of API design and scaling.

Building a Kubernetes cluster(YAML, 1000) -- Learn how to deploy a deep learning model on a Kubernetes cluster, understand the concepts of containerization and cluster management.

## Section 6: Explainability: Understanding deep learning models -- 1 week

Interpreting deep learning models(Python, 500) -- Learn how to interpret and understand deep learning models, understand the concepts of model interpretability and feature importance.

Building a LIME(Python, 500) -- Learn how to build a Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) for deep learning models, understand the concepts of model explanation.

## Section 7: Distributed deep learning: Scaling deep learning models -- 1 week

Building a PyTorch cluster(Python, 1000) -- Learn how to scale deep learning models using PyTorch, understand the concepts of distributed training and data parallelism.
