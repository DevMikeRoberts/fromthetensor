## From the Tensor to Transformers

[PyTorch][1] is hard (for me), a lot of tutorials are hard (for me) to follow,
and it's hard (for me) to undersand [software 2.0][2] from first principles.

#### Section 1: Intro: Working with tensors -- 0.5 weeks

- So about those tensors -- An overview. Describe what tensors are, and how to
initialize them. Understand the tensor operations.

#### Section 2: Bringup: What language is software 2.0 coded in? -- 1 week

- Linear Regression -- Your first little program! Getting the model working.
Learning about neural networks, optimizers, and criterions.
- Solving MNIST -- An intro chapter to training neural networks, fetch data
from a database. Fine tune parameters and neurons.

#### Section 3: Reinforcement: What is RL anyway? -- 2 weeks

- Coding a pong agent -- Fun and interesting, lots of training. Teaches you 
Q-learning. Initially agent loses all games, but starts winning after hours of
learning.
