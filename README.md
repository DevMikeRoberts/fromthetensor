# From the Tensor to Stable Diffusion

Inspired by [From the Transistor][0].

Machine learning is hard, a lot of tutorials are hard to follow, and
it's hard to understand [software 2.0][1] from first principles.

> You wanna be an ML engineer? There's the steps to get good at that.
>
> 1. Download a paper
> 2. Implement it
> 3. Keep doing this until you have skills

## Section 1: Intro: Cheating our way past the Tensor -- 0.5 weeks

So about those Tensors -- Course overview. Describe how Deep Learning models are buildable using Tensors and how different architectures like CNNs and RNNs use Tensors in different ways. Understand the concept of backpropagation and gradient descent.

Accelerated learning -- Training on a personal computer limits the reach of this course. Using something like Google Colab will allow anyone with a computer to play.

## Section 2: Bringup: What language is deep learning coded in? -- 0.5 weeks

Building a simple Neural Network(Python, 10) -- Your first little program! Getting the simulator working. Learning the basics of deep learning.

Building a simple CNN(Python, 100) -- An intro chapter to deep learning, learn how to build a simple CNN and understand the concepts of convolution and pooling.
