## From the Tensor to Transformers

[PyTorch][1] is hard (for me), a lot of tutorials are hard (for me) to follow,
and it's hard (for me) to undersand [software 2.0][2] from first principles.

#### Section 1: Intro: Working with tensors -- 0.5 weeks
- So about those tensors -- An overview. Describe what tensors are, and how to
initialize them. Understand some basic operations.

#### Section 2: Bringup: What language is software 2.0 coded in? -- 0.5 weeks
- Linear Regression -- Your first little program! Getting the model working.
Learning about reshape, optimizers, and criterions.
